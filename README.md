# Elastic-Waves-FD-dG
A repository containing codes and results from the article "A hybrid numerical method for elastic wave propagation in discontinuous media with complex geometry" published in the [journal of computational physics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2025.113745) by Andreas Granath (andreas.granath@umu.se) and Siyang Wang, Ume√• University.

The codes are provided as is and should be tested thoroughly if used for other experiments.
